AI-POWERED RESUME ANALYZER USING PYTHON
PROJECT OBJECTIVE
      This project is designed to extract key details from resumes, such as the candidate's name, email, phone number, skills, education, and work experience. It automates the resume screening process using Python.
TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED
•	Python (Main programming language)
•	pdfplumber (Extracting text from PDFs)
•	re (Regex) (Extracting structured information)
•	pandas (Data handling and storage - optional)
PROJECT WORKFLOW
1.	Extract text from a resume (PDF) using pdfplumber.
2.	Preprocess the extracted text to clean and format it.
3.	Extract key details (Name, Email, Phone, Skills, Education, Experience) using regex.
4.	Display the extracted information in the terminal.
5.	(Optional) Save the extracted details in an Excel file using pandas.
FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
•	Automate processing multiple resumes at once.
•	Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) for better accuracy.
•	Implement a Resume Scoring System based on job descriptions.
